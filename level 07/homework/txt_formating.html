    <br><b>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is not a programming language</b><br></br>because it does not have the ability to <u>perform logical operations, make decisions, or execute instructions.</u>Instead, HTML is a markup language used to structure content on the web. It defines the layout and elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, using a series of tags. While programming languages like JavaScript, Python, or C++ can manipulate data and control the behavior of a web page or application, HTML is strictly for organizing and displaying content. It lacks the functionality to create dynamic behavior or process data on its own.</p>
